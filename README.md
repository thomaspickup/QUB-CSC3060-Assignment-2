# CSC3060: Assignment 2
This is the project repository for assignment 2 on the CSC3060 at Queen's University Belfast.  

## Project Brief
In this assignment, we will use the features you developed in Assignment 1 to solve classification problems. Specifically, you will fit classifiers to your image data, in order to build and evaluate useful models that can predict the class labels for unseen images. This assignment is to be completed individually.

With the exception of Section 4, this assignment must be completed in R. Section 4 can be completed in Python, Java or R. Convenient and commonly used machine learning packages are available for R and Python, such as “class”, “caret” and “randomForest” (in the case of R). When you use a procedure that has an element of randomness (e.g. creating cross-validation folds) please use the seed value 3060 (your code should give the same results each time it runs).
